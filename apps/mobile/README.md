# Treadle mobile application
Our mobile application enables users to ride a real bike and get tokens in exchange. In the application user can mint, view and utilize them to get the tokens ("ride the bike"). Rides are being monitored by an optimized AI-model, which analyses the incoming data from sensors and decides whether the user has travelled with bike or not.
